this is an isometric test game
testing 2.5d environments

goals for this project

1.) 3d isometric environment which the player can move around in

2.) collision detect using blocks, not physics

3.) moveable camera, using same technique as rct

4.) experiment with moving cameras around on center of axises as well, instead of just corners
